\section{Introduction}

\textcolor{red}{I will start the introduction with my common blablabla on previous literature. This is a boring part of the paper but reviewers always ask for! }

If you put one line the text will go on a new parparagraph...

Now we can put a reference. To do that we should make use of the natbib package, then you can begin the bibliography and end it \citep{borcard}. With the hyperref package you can make links.

fast to write a papaer. In this moment I do not want to loos etime so I will put my citation like \citep{phelps}. 

\citet{phelps} stated that blablabla...

\section{Methods}
Here there might be a lot of formulas to be used!
\begin{equation}
    H = - \sum
\label{eq:h}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
    H = - \sum p \times \log{p}
\label{eq:shannon}
\end{equation}
quite simple right?

And here is the code used!:
\lstinputlisting[language=R]{list2.r}

\section{Results}
Into this section we will describe our fab results using figures! As we saw from Equation \ref{eq:shannon}, but also from that related to H, namely Equation  \ref{eq:h}.

Let's make use of a proper figure (Figure \ref{fig:sat}).
